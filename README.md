## Overview

The script uses the ["Temporary public policy to facilitate the granting of permanent residence for foreign nationals in Canada"](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/mandate/policies-operational-instructions-agreements/public-policies/trpr-international-graduates.html) website to check if the alerts in it have changed at all. The check is done every day, roughly at 9 AM. If any changes are identified, an e-mail will be sent to all recipients specified in the `env.py` file (not included).


## Machine Requirements

Docker is the only tool required on the machine running this program.

## Usage

### Inputs

No command-line inputs are required; only your `env.py` is needed.

**What should your `env.py` look like?**

```python
ENV = {
    'recipient': {
        'emails': ['recipient1@mail.com', 'recipient2@mailcom']
    },
    'sender': {
        'email': 'sender@email.com',
        'password': 'senderpassword'
    }
}
```
<p style="color: grey;">Note: If using Gmail as sender, you should enable the setting to allow access from "less secure apps".</p>

### Testing Environment

When the `testing` variable is set to `True`:

* The `test.html` file will be used as source, instead of the URL set.
* An e-mail will always be sent, regardless of if there is a change or not.
* Only the first recipient in the `emails` list will receive the e-mail.
* The e-mail subject will indicate whether the e-mail is a test or not.

### Execution

```
$ make
```
